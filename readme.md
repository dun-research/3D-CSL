# 3D-CSL: Self-supervised 3D Context Similarity Learning for Near-Duplicate Video Retrieval" 

This is an official pytorch implementation of our paper "3D-CSL: Self-supervised 3D Context Similarity Learning for Near-Duplicate Video Retrieval" [arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05352). This repository provides code for calculating similarities between the query and database videos. Also, the evaluation code and pre-trained weights are available to facilitate the reproduction of the paper's results.



## Installation
Requirements
 + python 3.6+
 + torch==1.7.1
 + (optional) mmcv==1.5.2 and mmaction2==0.24.0

You can install all the dependencies by 
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We also provide a distributed script for evaluation, which requires additional installation of mmcv and mmaction.
Please follow the official instruction to install, [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) and [mmaction2](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2)

## Evaluation
We provide code and pretrained weights to reproduce the experiments in the paper.

### Dataset Preparation

+ **Video Download**

  + In order to download the datasets, you can follow the official guidelines. 
  + Now the supported datasets are: [FIVR-200K](https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/FIVR-200K) and [CC_WEB_VIDEO](http://vireo.cs.cityu.edu.hk/webvideo/).

+ **Annotation File**
  + We use three files to organize the video relationships for each dataset like [Visil](https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/visil).
  + query_file: paths to file that contains the query videos, see example in [fivr-5k-queries.txt](data/fivr-5k-queries.txt)
  + database_file: paths to file that contains the database videos, see example in [fivr-5k-database.txt](data/fivr-5k-database.txt)
  + ann_file: relationship of query and database video, see example in [fivr.pkl](data/fivr.pkl)
  + please modified the default paths in [eval_dataset.py](datasets/eval_dataset.py)
  

### Run Evaluation
+ **Pretrained Weights**
  + You can download the pretrained model on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zd01H2dwewE3FzjF46Kc80icHEbcArCI?usp=sharing) or [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1kwfxqmZmwnlY_WagR58KlA)(password: jmnb).
  + After setup data and weights, you can use the following scripts to evaluate fivr-5k dataset:
  + To reproduce the reported results of paper, please switch to "fivr-200k" or "cc_web_video" dataset. The annotation files of these datasets can be found on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zd01H2dwewE3FzjF46Kc80icHEbcArCI?usp=sharing) or [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1kwfxqmZmwnlY_WagR58KlA)(password: jmnb).

## Use 3D-CSL to extract video features
3D-CSL is a well-trained video feature extractor that provides cost-effective clip-level features for video retrieval. Here is a toy example that extracts features for any videos.

```python
    import torch

    model = SimilarityRecognizer(model_type="base", batch_size=8)
    model.load_pretrained_weights(checkpoint)
    model.eval()

    imgs = torch.rand((1, 3, 8, 224, 224))
    features = model.extract_features(imgs)
```
